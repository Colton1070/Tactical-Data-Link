/**
 * AG0_TacticalDataLink Preprocessor Directives
 * 
 * This file handles conditional compilation flags for optional mod dependencies.
 * It's named with "!" prefix to ensure it's compiled before other scripts.
 * Defines are only valid in the module they are defined in, thus this script is defined in Scripts/Game, so references in other modules will fail.
 * 
 * For mod developers:
 * - If your mod may interface with this one, but you don't have this mod as a dependency, wrap code which interfaces with this mod using:
 *
 * #ifdef AG0_TacticalDataLink
 *     owner.FindComponent(AG0_TDLDeviceComponent);
 * #endif
 *
 * This ensures that the code is compiled only when the flag is set. If it's not, which it won't be if this mod is not loaded,
 * it will ignore that code as if it never existed.
